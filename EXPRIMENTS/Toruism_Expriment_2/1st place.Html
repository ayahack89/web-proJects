<P>The first forest management division to have jurisdiction over the Sundarbans was established in 1869. In 1875 a large portion of the mangrove 
<BR>forests was declared as reserved forests under the Forest Act, 1865 (Act VIII of 1865). The remaining portions of the forests were declared a 
<BR>reserve forest the following year and the forest, which was so far administered by the civil administration district, was placed under the 
<BR>control of the Forest Department. A forest division, which is the basic forest management and administration unit, was created in 1879 with 
<BR>the headquarters in Khulna, Bangladesh. The first management plan was written for the period 1893-1898.</P>

<P>In 1911, it was described as a tract of unexamined waste country and was excluded from the census. It then stretched for about 266 kilometres
<BR>(165 mi) from the mouth of the Hugli to the mouth of the Meghna river and was bordered inland by the three settled districts of the 24 parganas,
<BR>Khulna and Bakerganj. The total area (including water) was estimated at 16,900 square kilometres (6,526 sq mi). It was a water-logged jungle, in 
<BR>which tigers and other wild beasts abounded. Attempts at reclamation had not been very successful. The Sundarbans was everywhere intersected by
<BR>river channels and creeks, some of which afforded water communication throughout the Bengal region both for steamers and for native ships. The 
<BR>maximum part of the delta is located in Bangladesh.</P>
