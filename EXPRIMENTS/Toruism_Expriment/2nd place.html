<h6>[A] HISTORY;</h6>
<P>The city of Jaipur was founded by the King of Amer, Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II on 18 November 1727, who ruled from 1699 to 1743.
<BR>He planned to shift his capital from Amer, 11 kilometres (7 mi) to Jaipur to accommodate the growing population and increasing scarcity of water.
<BR>Jai Singh consulted several books on architecture and architects while planning the layout of Jaipur. Under the architectural guidance of Vidyadhar
<BR>Bhattacharya, Jaipur was planned based on the principles of Vastu Shastra and Shilpa Shastra.The construction of the city began in 1726 and 
<BR>took four years to complete the major roads, offices, and palaces. The city was divided into nine blocks, two of which contained the state buildings 
<BR>and palaces, with the remaining seven allotted to the public. Huge ramparts were built, pierced by seven fortified gates.During the rule of Sawai 
<BR>Ram Singh I, the city was painted pink to welcome HRH Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (who later became King Edward VII, Emperor of India), in 1876.
<BR>Many of the avenues still remain painted in pink, giving Jaipur a distinctive appearance and the epithet Pink city.
<BR>In the 19th century, the city grew rapidly and by 1900 it had a population of 160,000. The wide boulevards were paved and its chief industries 
<BR>were the working of metals and marble, fostered by a school of art founded in 1868. The city had three colleges, including a Sanskrit college (1865) 
<BR>and a girls' school (1867) opened during the reign of the Maharaja Ram Singh II.</P>





    
<P><BR>Large areas of the city including the airport were flooded in August 1981, resulting in the death of eight people and much damage to the city's 
<BR>Dravyavati River.The floods were caused by three days of cloud burst that produced more rain than the annual average.</P>
