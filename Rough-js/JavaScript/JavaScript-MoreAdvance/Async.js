/* Asyanc JavaScript */
/* Asynchronous programming is a technique that enables your program to start a 
potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task 
runs, rather than having to wait until that task has finished.*/

//Examale:-

console.log("Ayanabha is a handsome boy.");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Wait a minute! It's a dream.");
}, 3000);

console.log("He is a billioner.");
